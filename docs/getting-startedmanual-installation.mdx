# Manual Installation

## Installing the Application Locally
* Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:
```
gatsby new [folder-name] https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-docz-netlifycms
```
For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/my-docs`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:
```
gatsby new my-docs https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-docz-netlifycms
```
* Navigate to your new directory and run:
```
yarn develop
```
* You should now be running a new Gatsby site locally! ðŸŽ‰
